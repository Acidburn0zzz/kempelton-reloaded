# Kempelton Reloaded
Remake of the Kempelton theme for Firefox by [Arvid Axelsson] (http://arvidaxelsson.se/). 

Firefox code can be found in the ["ff"] (https://github.com/Lootyhoof/kempelton-reloaded/tree/master/ff) folder; Pale Moon code in the ["pm"] (https://github.com/Lootyhoof/kempelton-reloaded/tree/master/pm) folder. Releases can be found in the ["releases"] (https://github.com/Lootyhoof/kempelton-reloaded/tree/master/releases) folder.

## Building
Simply download the contents of the folder you want to build (either ff or pm) and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.
